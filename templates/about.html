      <h2>What is News-Slider?</h2>
      <p>
        News-Slider aggregates news headlines from a variety of sources and assigns each a bias score on a scale from -10 (most left) to +10 (most right). 
        These scores are derived from a synthesis of established media bias charts, including graphics from Ad Fontes Media (seen below) and other independent assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to promote transparency and media literacy by allowing users to quickly see the political leanings of different outlets, 
        empowering them to make more informed decisions about the news they consume.
      </p>
      <p>
        By visualizing bias in a quantitative manner, News-Slider provides a unique perspective on todayâ€™s news ecosystem.
